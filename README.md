# CLUE DApp (iOS and Android)
In order to increase adoption and lower the barrier of entry, CLUE DApp will focus on optimizing the user experience for first-time users.

### DApp-specific Wallet
Interacting with DApps require having a wallet and basic understanding of how to use them. The user has to download the wallet application, store their private key in a safe place, and use browser plugins (MetaMask, etc) to interact existing DApps.

The barrier is pretty high considering there are several pre-requisite steps before interacting with DApps.

Instead of requiring a wallet, DApps should generate a new wallet as part of the sign-up process.

Having a wallet inside of the DApp will greatly lower the barrier, reducing the additional steps to get started by several factors.

#### Separation of Concern
Users are used to the concept of having multiple accounts for different services (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and etc), and the accounts are mutually exclusive to one another. If one account is compromised, then it’s safe to assume others won’t be affected (unless the user has the same password for all of their services).

From a user’s perspective, it is reasonable to assume that their primary account should be kept as private as possible, and a new account should be created with mutual exclusivity.

For the users on the DApp, the basic security model provided by application frameworks should be more than enough, and we should always encourage users to make frequent withdrawals.

### Use Common Lingos
From an average user’s perspective, some of the DApp lingos can be difficult to understand, and as humans, lack of understanding leads to lack of confidence.

For example, "Create a new Wallet" can also be described as, "Create an Account" which will help users make straightforward decisions on getting started.
